MULTITHREADING NOTES (BEGINNER)
CPU

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the “brain” of the computer.
It executes instructions and performs operations such as arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output.

Real world example:
A chef in a kitchen preparing dishes.

CORE

A Core is an individual processing unit inside the CPU.
Modern CPUs have multiple cores, meaning they can process multiple tasks at the same time.

Example:
A quad-core processor has 4 cores → 4 tasks can run in parallel (browser, music, downloads, video call).

PROGRAM

A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language for a specific task.

Example:
Microsoft Word is a program for creating and editing documents.

PROCESS

A process is an executing instance of a program.
When a program runs, the operating system creates a process to manage it.

Example:
Opening Word creates a Word process in the OS.

THREAD

A thread is the smallest unit of execution inside a process.
A process can contain multiple threads that run independently and share memory.

Example:
A web browser runs each tab as a separate thread inside one browser process.

RELATION: PROGRAM → PROCESS → THREAD

Program (Blueprint)
Process (Running program)
Thread (Smallest execution unit inside process)

MULTITASKING

Multitasking = ability of OS to run multiple processes at the same time.

Single-Core CPU:
OS rapidly switches between processes → illusion of parallel tasks (time slicing).

Multi-Core CPU:
Different processes run truly parallel on different cores.

Example:
Listening to music + opening WhatsApp + downloading a file.

MULTITHREADING

Multithreading = a process creates multiple threads to run tasks concurrently.

Example:
A browser:
• Thread 1 → Render page
• Thread 2 → Run JavaScript
• Thread 3 → Handle user input
• Thread 4 → Manage downloads

Multithreading improves responsiveness and performance by dividing tasks into smaller units (threads).

TIME SLICING

• CPU time is divided into tiny slices (quanta).
• OS scheduler assigns each process/thread a time slice.
• No program keeps the CPU forever.

Purpose: fairness & responsiveness.

CONTEXT SWITCHING

• Switching from one process/thread to another by saving the current state and loading the next state.
• Happens when time slice expires or when a thread is blocked.

Benefit: enables concurrent execution even on a single-core CPU.

MULTITASKING vs MULTITHREADING

Multitasking → running multiple programs.
Multithreading → running multiple threads inside the same program.

Both concepts together make systems fast and responsive.

MULTITHREADING IN JAVA

Java has built-in support for multithreading.

Key points in Java:
• A thread is a lightweight process.
• Main thread starts automatically when program runs.
• Java provides Thread class and Runnable interface to create threads.
• JVM + OS manage thread scheduling, time slicing, and context switching.

Single-Core System:
Threads take turns (illusion of parallelism).

Multi-Core System:
Threads can run truly parallel on multiple cores.

BENEFITS OF MULTITHREADING

• Better CPU utilization
• Faster task execution
• Improved application responsiveness
• Independent operations inside the same program

Example:
Video player:
• Main thread – User interface
• Thread 2 – Audio playback
• Thread 3 – Video decoding
• Thread 4 – Subtitles

WHERE MULTITHREADING IS USED (Real World)

• Gaming (rendering, physics, audio)
• Banking transactions
• Chat / messaging applications
• Web servers handling multiple client requests
• Streaming apps (video, audio, buffering)
• Stock market / trading systems

COMMON THREAD ISSUES (IMPORTANT)

• Race conditions
• Deadlocks
• Starvation
• Thread leaks (threads never end)
• Context switching overhead

KEY TAKEAWAY

• Program is code.
• Process is running program.
• Thread is the smallest executable unit inside a process.
• Multitasking handles multiple processes.
• Multithreading handles multiple threads inside a process.
• OS time slicing and context switching make concurrency possible.
• Multi-core systems allow true parallel execution.

ONE-LINE MEMORY FORMULA

CPU → Cores
Program → Process → Threads
Multitasking → many programs
Multithreading → many threads inside a program

SMALL SUMMARY FOR INTERVIEW INTRO

“Multithreading in Java allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process.
It improves performance by utilizing CPU cores efficiently and enhances responsiveness by executing independent tasks in parallel.”

SAMPLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

Q1) What is a thread?
A thread is the smallest execution unit inside a process.

Q2) Difference between process and thread?
A process is an executing program; a thread is a lightweight unit inside a process that shares the same memory.

Q3) Multitasking vs Multithreading?
Multitasking runs multiple applications, multithreading runs multiple threads in the same application.

Q4) How does multithreading run on a single-core CPU?
Through time slicing + context switching.

Q5) How does multithreading run on multi-core CPUs?
Threads run in true parallel across different cores.

Q6) Why is multithreading important?
For performance, responsiveness, and maximum CPU utilization.

Q7) What is context switching?
Saving current thread state and loading next thread state to share CPU.
